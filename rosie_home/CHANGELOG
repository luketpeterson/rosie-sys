2021-02-12  Jamie Jennings  <jamie@rosie-lang.org>

	* 1.2.2:

	FIXED: Build failed on some macos Big Sur installations because Apple no
	longer ships the readline library.

	And the changes made below for 1.2.2-beta* are included.

2021-01-13  Jamie Jennings  <jamie@rosie-lang.org>

	* 1.2.2-beta-4:

	FIXED: Issue #114.  The documentation had some examples that no longer
	worked, because the '-o' option must now be placed AFTER the command
	('match', 'grep', or 'trace') on the command line.

2020-05-01  Jamie Jennings  <jamie@rosie-lang.org>

	* 1.2.2-beta:

	FIXED: Issue #105. There was a bug that surfaced when using --rpl on the
	command line with an argument that instantiated a package.

	FIXED: Added platform detection appropriate to NixOS.

	ENHANCED: The build is now implemented in phases, to make life easier
	for packagers. 'make fetch' retrieves git submodules, so that all files
	needed to build are available locally.  'make compile' compiles rosie,
	with results going into a local build directory.  'make copy_to_build'
	copies into the build directory the files (like documentation, and the
	standard rpl library) that do not need compilation.  'make check' does a
	very basic test that the executable in the build directory works.
	Finally, 'make install' simply copies from the build directory to the
	install destination, which defaults to /usr/local (configurable by
	setting DESTDIR=<path> on the make command line).

	NOTE: Now testing with address sanitizing and (separately) with
	valgrind.

	NOTE: Now testing (via docker) on Arch, Centos, Elementary, Fedora, and
	Ubuntu, using the latest stable releases as of 30 April 2020.

	NOTE: The 'test' target of the Makefile now looks for an optional ROSIE
	variable which, when supplied, points to the rosie executable to be used
	for testing.  This allows the system (or any) installation to be fully
	white-box and black-box tested.  Black-box only is not yet a supported
	option.

	FIXED: A bug in the trace capability that surfaced when tracing a
	complemented bracket expression.

	FIXED: Issue #113, where 'word.dq' failed to match escaped backslashes
	properly.

	CHANGED: To run the rosie executable out of the build directory, use the
	script 'rosie' at the top of the download directory.  The script ensures
	that LD_LIBRARY_PATH is set to the build directory so that
	build/bin/rosie will be able to load it.
	The need for this script is due to an internal change that should not,
	in other ways, be visible to users: the rosie executable now dynamically
	loads librosie.so (librosie.dylib on MacOS).

	FIXED: Issue #112, where we did not give enough credit in our README to
	the handful of regex libraries that support the /x switch, which allows
	whitespace and comments inside a regex.

	ENHANCED: Issue #109 was essentially a user error, but we noticed that
	the error message could be better for duplicate characters in a
	character set, so we enhanced the message.

	FIXED: Issue #102. The (usually relative) path to the rosie library
	files (including rpl files and compiled lua files) was part of the rosie
	executable, "baked in" at compile time.  Now, librosie simply looks in
	its own directory for 'rosie', the directory with those needed files.
	E.g. a system installation in /usr/local/lib will include
	/usr/local/lib/librosie.so and /usr/local/lib/rosie.  The latter is the
	directory with the files needed at runtime.


2019-10-06  Jamie Jennings  <jamie@rosie-lang.org>

	* 1.2.1

	ENHANCED: The output of the 'expand' command has been improved to be
	more understandable (though more improvements are needed) and to be more
	faithful (that is, to more often generate valid RPL).

	FIXED: Merge request !76 fixed a bug in the Makefile wrt putting
	librosie.h into the correct directory.

	FIXED: Issue #109. Where the error message was confusing, it is now more
	clear.

	FIXED: Issue #108. A unit test was being blocked when it should not have
	been.  This was a bug.

	ENHANCED: Added line numbers to unit test output.

2019-07-14  Jamie Jennings  <jamie@rosie-lang.org>

	* 1.2.0:

	FIXED: Issue #105 (creating a package on the fly using the CLI flag
	"--rpl").

	ENHANCED: Documentation for librosie in doc/librosie.md

	EXPERIMENTAL: Issue #103 Support for backreferences, see the file
	extra/examples/backref.rpl for examples.

	NEW: rpl/re.rpl with patterns for people who know regex and want to use
	a similar set of short names, e.g. \s in regex is re.s in RPL.

	NEW: rpl/char.rpl with a few patterns for processing UTF-8 and ASCII
	characters.  These could be extended in future, e.g. for UTF-16.

	REFACTOR: Internal change to how RPL infix expressions, e.g. A/B, are
	parsed.  New technique implements Dykstra's "Shunting Yard" algorithm.
	The change in the grammar caused the RPL language version number to
	increment to RPL 1.3.

	REFACTOR: The unit testing code that implements the "rosie test" command
	has been significantly refactored.

	CHANGED: The way unit test results are printed has been enhanced to
	include more information.

	ENHANCED: The CLI now accepts "--help" everywhere.  The "rosie help"
	command is still the intended way to get help.

	REFACTOR: The first set of steps towards loading compiled patterns from
	disk have been implemented.

	FIXED: Misc small unreported bugs.  See commit log for details.

2019-03-11  Jamie Jennings  <jamie@rosie-lang.org>

	* 1.1.0:

	CHANGED: In net.rpl, the pattern "net.url" is now identical to
	"net.url_common". The previous definition of "net.url", which matches
	URLs according to the RFC spec, is now called "net.url_strict" to follow
	the convention established by "net.fqdn_strict".

	ENHANCED: The json.rpl package now includes patterns "json.object" and
	"json.array", for those occasions when matching any "json.value" is not
	what you want to do.

	CHANGED: The C header file "librosie.h" has been revised so that it can
	be used as a single header for code that calls "librosie" functions.  And
	"make install" now copies this header to DESTDIR/include.

	MOVED: The librosie "client libraries" (interfaces) have been moved into
	their own repositories in https://gitlab.com/rosie-community/clients.

	FIXED: Issue #85.  The JSON output no longer escapes the forward slash
	(solidus) because it is not required to do so (and doing so makes JSON
	harder to read).

	FIXED: Issue #99 (bug in pattern "time.rfc3339"). Also fixed a bug in
	the pattern where it deviated from the specification by allowing
	whitespace before the offset.

	FIXED: Bug in "time.rfc2822" where it did not, by default, accept
	fractional seconds when present.  (Technically, fractional seconds is an
	extension to the standard, but it is a common one.  Use
	"time.rfc2822_strict" to follow the standard.)

	CHANGED: The pattern "net.ipv4" used to accept any 3-digit number as a
	segment.  It now accepts only 0-255.

	CHANGED: The pattern "net.any" used to accept the input "1.2.3", which
	is a valid domain name, and now it rejects such input.  This was done by
	modifying "fqdn_practical".

	ENHANCED: The pattern "net.ipv6_strict" is now exported, making it
	available to use when you want to match ipv6 addresses but reject mixed
	ipv6/ipv4 addresses.

	ENHANCED: Issue #81.  The unit test framework now supports tests of
	local identifiers with the "-- test local <id> ..." syntax.

	ENHANCED: Unit test reporting is now more verbose, and includes a count
	of blocked tests as well as passed and failed.

	NEW: A sample installation script for WSL (Linux on Windows) in
	extra/WSL/rosie_install.sh.

	NEW: A small library for matching version strings
	(rpl/ver.rpl). Currently only supports semver.

	FIXED: Issue #80 (odd rpl compiler error message).

	FIXED: Issue #91 (error in documentation about negative look-behind).

	FIXED: Issue #87 (entering "." in the REPL threw an error).

	ENHANCED: The "make install" script now looks for an existing Rosie
	installation, and asks you to run "make installforce" to overwrite it. 

	EXPERIMENTAL: The "rosie match" command takes an optional "--time"
	option (after "match") which prints match time (in the user process) and
	total time (also user).  The total time is the match time plus the time
	needed to encode the output.  Formats meant for humans, like "-o color"
	and "-o jsonpp" are slow.  THIS EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE MAY BE MODIFIED IN
	A FUTURE RELEASE.  DO NOT DEPEND ON ITS OUTPUT FORMAT OR DETAILS OF ITS
	OPERATION.

	AND: A lot of internal refactoring was done in order to support the
	future ability to build the run-time separately from the compiler and
	the CLI.  Note that the rosie-lpeg submodule is no longer needed.  Also,
	some small unreported bugs were fixed.

2018-06-24  Jamie Jennings  <jjennings@us.ibm.com>

	*  1.0.0:

	CHANGED: In the definition of "all.things", a sequence of letters and
	numbers is now recognized as an identifier.

	CHANGED: Among the strings that "all.things" will recognize as an
	identifier, the ":" character has been removed.  Now, "foo:bar" will
	match as a word, a punctuation mark, and another word, where previously
	it matched as a single identifier.

	CHANGED: Now, "net.any" includes "net.url_common" instead of "net.url".
	The pattern "url_common" matches URLs that have "://" after the scheme.

2018-06-21  Jamie Jennings  <jjennings@us.ibm.com>

	* 1.0.0-beta-13:

	FIXED: time.simple now accepts "0:00"

	FIXED: all.things now classifies unsigned floats like "1.2" as floats

	FIXED: black box tests now use "--norcfile" so they do not accidentally
	pick up the ~/.rosierc file of the user running the tests

2018-06-20  Jamie Jennings  <jjennings@us.ibm.com>

	* 1.0.0-beta-12:

	FIXED: Moved from github.com to gitlab.com.

	FIXED: The dependency finding function that the CLI uses to
	automatically load packages was not looking inside bracket expressions
	for RPL identifiers.

2018-06-05  Jamie Jennings  <jjennings@us.ibm.com>

	* 1.0.0-beta-11:

	FIXED: Bug in repl introduced in beta-10, when a change in color string
	handling revealed a testing flaw whose root cause was a bug in
	util.lua's os_execute_capture() function.

	CHANGED: The 'subs' output encoder now returns an empty string when
	there is a match but it has no submatches.  (It previously returned nil,
	which caused a problem in librosie.c)

	ENHANCED: The 'ci' macro now operates on character sets in addition to
	literals.  It is still shallow, in the sense that it cannot change a
	pattern bound to an identifier.  E.g. 'ci:foo' is the same as 'foo'.

2018-05-11  Jamie Jennings  <jjennings@us.ibm.com>

	* 1.0.0-beta-10:

	FIXED: Bug in num.rpl introduced in beta-9.  Related: For better
	separation of responsibilities, the all.rpl package now tries harder to
	distinguish between things that look alike, e.g. "1.2" is a float, not a
	partially qualified domain.  And 'all.things' will parse "F0" as an
	indentifier, not a hex number, even though it could be either.

	FIXED: Issue #79.  The incorrect error message has been changed to the
	correct one.

	ENHANCED: The default color assignments for the 'color' output encoder
	is now visible via the 'rosie config' command and the 'config() API'.
	This makes it easier to see and modify it, and is a step in the
	direction of supporting an /etc/rosierc file in the future.

	ENHANCED: Three trace styles ("json", "full", "condensed") are now
	supported in the API and CLI.  In the CLI, the '-o' option to the trace
	command selects the trace style, which defaults to "condensed".

	CHANGED: The CLI will now accept the '-o' option only AFTER the
	commands match, grep, and trace.  Previously, '-o' could be put earlier
	on the command line.

2018-04-24  Jamie Jennings  <jjennings@us.ibm.com>

	* 1.0.0-beta-9:

	CHANGED: The output option named "matches" is now named "data" for
	consistency with the others, particularly "subs", since those are both
	components of a match.

	CHANGED: Removed the output option named "default".

	FIXED: Bug in REPL when user enters sample data that is not a valid RPL
	string, e.g. one with an invalid escape sequence.

	FIXED: The pattern "num.float" now accepts all valid JSON numbers.
	Also, "frac" (for "fraction") is now an alias and will no longer appear
	in output from the "num" patterns.

	ENHANCED: When a string containing RPL is loaded into an engine, and
	that string declares that it is a package, say "foo", then a legitimate
	package "foo" is created.  A subsequent call to	engine.load("import foo")
	will now succeed.  An attempt to force a re-import via
	engine.import("foo") will fail, however, because the engine has no way
	of loading the RPL source again (it is not on the file system).

2018-04-23  Jamie Jennings  <jjennings@us.ibm.com>

	* 1.0.0-beta-8:

	ADDED: New functions in librosie for clients that want to examine how
	RPL is parsed.  For expressions and blocks (sets of statements), you can
	ask librosie to parse them, compute the free variables (references), and
	compute the packages that need to be imported before the RPL can be
	used.

	CHANGED: It is no longer valid to give an empty string to the load()
	function.  E.g. the CLI will now complain on --rpl ''.

	CHANGED: The net.fqdn pattern used to accept floats like 1.2e03.  It no
	longer does.  You can use net.fdqn_strict to accept all valid partially
	qualified domain names, which would include 1.2e03.

	CHANGED: In rosie.py, the boolean output encoder now returns True or
	False instead of True or None.

	ENHANCED: The cli and librosie now follow symlinks to find the Rosie
	installation files (lib/*.luac, rpl/*.rpl, and others).

	FIXED: The new_engine() function is now thread-safe.  There's a mutex
	around previously unsafe part, so simultaneous engine creation in
	multiple threads is safe, but part of it will only run in one thread at
	a time.

2018-04-10  Jamie Jennings  <jjennings@us.ibm.com>

	* 1.0.0-beta-7:

	CHANGED: The rosie.py module for using Rosie with Python now supports a
	load() function.  It is OPTIONAL to use load() in general, but is
	necessary if you have multiple Rosie installations and you want to load
	a specific librosie.so|dylib.

2018-04-08  Jamie Jennings  <jjennings@us.ibm.com>

	* 1.0.0-beta-6:

	FIXED: The liblua library now uses a non-locking feof to avoid a
	deadlock that was observed due to a race condition when many threads
	were using rosie.  Related: librosie no longer calls fflush() with a
	NULL argument, which was triggering a walk over all open files.

	FIXED: A build issue related to the (dreaded) use of recursive MAKE.

	CHANGED: A breaking change was made to the Python librosie API in
	rosie.py.  The rosie.engine() function no longer accepts any arguments,
	whereas before it took the path to librosie.  Since the path to find
	librosie can only be set before any engines are created, and will apply
	to all engines, it has its own API: rosie.set_librosie_dir().

	ENHANCED: The multi-threaded test program, src/librosie/C/mt.c, is now
	structured more like a typical use case, in which each thread makes a
	rosie engine, uses it, and then finalizes it.

2018-03-31  Jamie Jennings  <jjennings@us.ibm.com>

	* 1.0.0-beta-5:

	ENHANCED: The build process (Makefile) now allows librosie/rosie to be
	built using a relative path to find the rosie installation.  That path
	is relative to the librosie install directory when it starts with a
	double slash ('//'), and relative to the current directory otherwise.
	We recommend AGAINST building with a path that is relative to the
	current directory, for security reasons.

	FIXED: a bug in rosie.py that occured when printing some kinds of
	errors.

	CHANGED: warnings printed by execute_rcfile() are now returned to the
	librosie client instead.

2018-03-16  Jamie Jennings  <jjennings@us.ibm.com>

	* 1.0.0-beta-4:

	FIXED: Some commands entered at the CLI did not respect some of the
	command line options, e.g. "test" did not adopt the "--libpath"
	setting.

	FIXED: Some loader/compiler/parser messages, which are called
	"violations", did not convert properly to JSON in librosie for return to
	the calling program.

2018-03-15  Jamie Jennings  <jjennings@us.ibm.com>

	* 1.0.0-beta-3:

	ENHANCED: The sample docker files in extra/docker now includes python 3
	and the official arch distro.

	ENHANCED: There should be NO compile warnings from gcc as long as it is
	gcc version 7 or higher.  Older versions will warn about the fallthrough
	attribute, because they don't understand it.

	FIXED: In rosie.py, a compiled pattern is now a proper python object,
	and it contains an engine reference so that the engine cannot be GC'd
	before its compiled patterns.  (This does not happen in Python 2.7, but
	it does in Python 3.6.)

	FIXED: Rosie is once again easy to install on OS X!  See
	https://github.com/jamiejennings/homebrew-rosie

2018-03-09  Jamie Jennings  <jjennings@us.ibm.com>

	* 1.0.0-beta-2:

	CHANGED: The (undocumented) output encoder "none" has been removed.

	NEW: An output encoder called "bool" was added.  It is not useful from
	the command line, but when using librosie's match() function, it will
	return a code 0/1 indicating a match or no match.

	NEW: Python example program extra/examples/generic_sloc.py.

	ENHANCED: When the user specifies an output encoder name that is not
	supported, a proper error is returned.  Previously, the error that was
	returned could be confused with a bug in librosie.

	ENHANCED: `make install` now installs the rosie man page as well.

	ENHANCED: Makefile was tweaked so that it works with the new brew
	(http://brew.sh) formula for install Rosie on OS X.

	FIXED: a bug in pattern net.fqdn_practical that caused it to include a
	leading space in the capture.

2018-02-25  Jamie Jennings  <jjennings@us.ibm.com>

	* 1.0.0-beta-1

	ENHANCED: The python module, rosie.py, now works with Python 2.7 and
	Python 3.6.

	CHANGED: The python module, rosie.py, now requires python 'bytes'
	arguments, not python strings.  And it returns 'bytes' values as
	well. Probably the rosie.py API should be enhanced to accept string
	arguments and convert them to bytes, assuming they are UTF-8 encoded.

	CHANGED: The all.things pattern has been modified such that text like
	"C1" will be recognized as an identifier instead of a hex number.

	CHANGED: The num.any pattern now looks for how the number ends, so that
	the first 3 characters of "1.2.3.4" will not match as a float "1.2".
	Note that num.float (and num.decimal) will match that, but num.any will
	not.

	CHANGED: In package net, introduced fqdn_practical to be an alternative
	to fqdn_strict. (And, net.any looks for fqdn_practical now.)  The
	difference is that fqdn_strict will match "1.2" as a partially qualified
	domain name, but fqdn_practical will not.

	CHANGED: The sample go client cannot be used with go1.9.4 due to a bug
	in that go release.  The src/librosie/go/setup.sh script now checks for
	that go version and produces an error.  We recommend go1.10.

	CHANGED: syntax of grammar statements, which now require an 'in'
	clause.  This was done to accommodate future enhancements to the RPL
	language.  The RPL version level is now 1.2.

	NEW: ~/.rosierc is processed if found, unless the --norcfile option is
	given.  And the --rcfile option can be used to load a different
	initialization file.

	NEW: --colors <str> option to define which colors to use when printing
	colorized output.

	ENHANCED: Previously, the REPL did not interpolate strings entered as
	sample data.  Now, escape sequences like \n, \xAA, and the Unicode
	escape sequences can be used in sample data.

	ENHANCED: The "standard prelude" can be imported like any other
	package.

	CHANGED: The config() API now returns an array of JSON objects, where
	each object is a table of configuration settings.  The first is for the
	rosie installation, the second for the engine specifically, and the last,
	if present, is a table of output encoder parameters.

2018-02-03  Jamie Jennings  <jjennings@us.ibm.com>

	* 1.0.0-alpha-10

	NEW: output encoder 'jsonpp' (json pretty printing)

	NEW: additional sample docker file 'ubuntu-go', which installs golang,
	and then builds and tests the go client of librosie.

	UPDATED: Most of the docs are now up to date.  Please open an issue if
	you find an error.

	FIXED: a bug in error printing at the command line.

2018-01-20  Jamie Jennings  <jjennings@us.ibm.com>

	* 1.0.0-alpha-9

	NEW: Unicode patterns in rpl/Unicode for each Unicode script, block,
	general category, word|line|sentence|grapheme break, numeric type, and
	(binary) property.
	  * Limitation: Unicode aliases are not yet supported, so you cannot
	    write, e.g. "Category.Uppercase_Letter".  You have to use the
	    official short name, "Category.Lu".
	  * Limitation: The RPL compiler is slow, particularly on long
	    (automatically generated) patterns like the ones in
	    rpl/Unicode/Category.rpl.  Some planned refactoring will result in
	    all the Unicode patterns being pre-compiled, meaning that they can
	    be loaded in binary form from disk when needed.
	  * Future: A user should be able to download any Unicode Character
	    Database from http://unicode.org and run a rosie utility to generate
	    patterns.  Today, we support only Unicode 10.0.0.

	NEW: A working Go client of librosie, in src/librosie/go/rosie/rosie.go

	BREAKING CHANGE: CLI option "--version" to a command "version".

	BREAKING CHANGE: The librosie functions now return a NULL pointer for
	"messages" when there are none, instead of a string representation of an
	empty JSON object.

	BREAKING CHANGE: The librosie APIs for alloc_limit and libpath changed.

	BREAKING CHANGE (in theory): Rosie is now completely independent of the
	operating system's locale system.  If you ever wrote patterns using,
	e.g. [:alpha:] and counted on the meaning to change when you changed
	your OS locale setting, then please OPEN AN ISSUE.  Rosie can certainly
	support this capability (in a portable way), but doing so is not a known
	requirement at this time.

	CHANGED: CLI now prints error messages to stderr, not stdout.

	CHANGED: Packages "list"ed now show the file from which they were loaded.

	CHANGED: The output of the test command now includes the *full* filename.

	CHANGED: Sample docker files now force re-build when the branch has
	changed.  This is a hack, and it relies on (1) the extra/docker/run
	script, and (2) access by that script to the .git directory in the rosie
	build directory.

	CHANGED: The Lua repl, which is used for white-box testing and
	debugging, is now optional instead of always present.  Compile with
	"make LUADEBUG=1" to get the Lua repl, and to use it, invoke rosie with
	"rosie -D".

	CHANGED: The symbols in librosie.[so|dylib] are now hidden, except of
	course for the functions rosie_* that the library exports.

	REMOVED: "make installtest" (until we decide on a good way to implement
	tests of the system installation of rosie).

	CHANGED: the rosie executable into a single statically linked binary,
	instead of a script.

	CHANGED: Now, librosie.a|so|dylib will look for the rosie files
	(lib/*.luac, rpl/*) in one fixed location in the file system, and that
	location is compiled in.  Any location could be specified, but the
	Makefile knows how to generate two versions:
	  * local, which looks for rosie in the root of the build directory
	  * system, which looks for rosie in DESTDIR (defaults to /usr/local)
	This affects anything built with librosie, which now includes the rosie
	CLI.

	CHANGED: librosie is itself now statically linked.  It no longer loads
	any dynamic libraries.  As a result, there are no longer any so|dylib
	files in the lib directory, and the only libraries that are installed
	via "make install" are librosie.a and librosie.so|dylib.

	FIXED: a subtle bug which revealed that, on some linux variants, dlopen
	caches (at least the) dli.fname value.  Discovered this after learning
	that basename/dirname may change their (char *) argument.  This seems
	like a security hole, and we should dig into it.  Fortunately, it no
	longer affects Rosie, since we no longer utilize dli.fname.

	NEW: rpl/builtin/prelude.rpl and the rpl/builtin dir.

	CHANGED: Removed support for 5,6-byte UTF-8 since those are deprecated.

	CHANGED: Removed "halt" (which was undocumented) from standard prelude.

	CHANGED: The multi-threaded test program now writes output files to /tmp.

	FIXED: Tracing now works on built-in definitions.

	FIXED: When the CLI auto-import fails, it now does so silently, because
	the user may have used other means to ensure that packages are loaded,
	such as an import statement on the command line.

2018-01-05  Jamie Jennings  <jjennings@us.ibm.com>

	* 1.0.0-alpha-8

	NEW: The "fancy" new character set support is ready for users to try
	out.  Expressions are now allowed within square brackets.  The new
	operator & is useful here, since it provides short notation for set
	intersection.  Examples:
	[[A-Z] & [A-F]] is equivalent to [A-F];
	[[ \t] comment] is equivalent to {[ \t] / comment};
	[comment] is a syntax error; it is interpreted as a character list, and
	it has a duplicate character ("m");
	[cmt] is a character list matching "c", "m", and "t";
	[[] cmt] is equivalent to pattern cmt;
	[[] p1 p2] is equivalent to {p1 / p2};
	[] matches nothing (it is a disjunction of zero characters);
	[^] matches everything (it is the complement of []);

	NEW: A couple of scripts that count source lines of code were added in
	the extra/examples directory.

	NEW: Three kinds of new escape sequences are supported.  They are valid
	in literal strings (in double quotes) and in character lists/ranges (in
	square brackets).  They are:
	\xHH  hex escape; HH are hex digits; range \x00-\xFF
	\uHHHH  unicode escape; 4 hex digits; range \u0000-\uFFFF
	\UHHHHHHHH  long unicode escape; 8 hex digits; range \U00000000-\U0010FFFF
	Note that the hex digits may be upper or lower case.

	NEW: Every part of Rosie should now be Unicode-aware, as long as the
	encoding of the input data is UTF-8.

	CHANGED: Unfortunately, this is a change that can BREAK EXISTING CODE.
	Character lists like [abc] and ranges like [a-z] now enforce these two
	rules:
	(1) To include these characters, they MUST be escaped: [ ] ^ -
	For example, [+\-] matches + and -, and [^\^] matches anything but ^.
	(2) In a range, the ends of the range MUST be in order.  So [a-z] is
	legal, but [z-a] is not.

	FIXED: The "make install" command now copies liblua.5.3.so/dylib into
	the destination directory, alongside librosie.so/dylib.

	FIXED: Bug in the repl command ".load" introduced in the previous
	release.

	FIXED: The dot "." is intended to match any unicode character, or,
	failing that, a single non-character byte.  It did not match a
	non-character byte until this fix.

	FIXED: Default compiler is cc (clang) on OS X.  Use
	"make CC=gcc" to force gcc.

2017-12-22  Jamie Jennings  <jjennings@us.ibm.com>

	* 1.0.0-alpha-7

	CHANGED: The rosie configuration returned by rosie_config() in librosie
	now has a more simple structure.  It is a list of entries, each of which
	contains a name, description, value, and possibly other attributes.

	CHANGED: The sample Go client remains unfinished.  The part that is
	implemented only works because the main goroutine is locked to the OS
	thread.  Without this, the tiny stacks allocated by Go cause problems
	for goroutines that use librosie.

	CHANGED: librosie now provides rosie_loadfile.

	FIXED: REPL engine now gets the libpath set on the command line (if any).

	FIXED: Violation messages returned by librosie now have internal data
	stripped away, leaving only text that is useful to a librosie client.

	CHANGED: librosie now requires pthreads to compile.

	CHANGED: Now building librosie.dylib on OS X because .dylib and .so
	files are treated differently by Python's cffi package (grrrr).

	NEW: There are now 3 sample clients for librosie that are written in C:
	one statically linked, one dynamically linked, and one statically linked
	and multi-threaded.  See src/librosie/C/Makefile ("test" target) for how
	to invoke each one.

	INFO: Some future changes may be coming to how librosie is built.  Today
	it links with lua.5.3.so in the same directory, which can complicate
	'make install'.

	CHANGED: In librosie, the signature of rosie_import changed to provide
	an additional "output arg" that contains the name of the package
	actually imported.

	NEW: The customized version of lpeg that rosie uses has been modified to
	never read past the end of the input string.  It would peek beyond the
	end by one char, which caused no harm when the input was a string
	produced by lua_tolstring, which guarantees a null terminator.  In
	Rosie, the input can be a "pointer and length" struct, where it is
	incorrect to reference the char at the address pointer+length.

	NEW: librosie is now thread-safe.  Example program in
	src/librosie/C/mt.c.  The required stack size for a thread running a
	rosie matching engine is currently 1MB.  Some implementation changes
	could reduce this, possibly down to 512KB.  If you would like to see
	this, please open an issue on Github.

	FIXED: Updated docker files in extra/docker to reflect best practices
	and to run all librosie client tests.

2017-11-25  Jamie Jennings  <jjennings@us.ibm.com>

	* 1.0.0-alpha-6

	FIXED: Unreported bug where the "rosie list" command did not show the
	correct colors in the table of patterns.

	CHANGED: The names of the platform-specific MAC patterns in net.rpl.
	THIS COULD BREAK EXISTING RPL CODE, which is why it's happening now, in
	an alpha release.

	CHANGED: With implementation of Issue #68, the "text" output encoder was
	renamed "matches" (to be analogous to "subs"), and the "nocolor" option
	was removed because it's now redundant.

	NEW: Makefile now builds librosie.a in addition to librosie.so.

	NEW: Issue #68 implemented.  Color output now prints the entire input
	line, with match segments in color.  When no color is defined for a
	match, the default is a bold version of the default shell color.

	NEW: Started working on a Go client for librosie, but it's not done.


2017-11-14  Jamie Jennings  <jjennings@us.ibm.com>

	* 1.0.0-alpha-5

	MERGED PR #67 (from IBMer vmorris) containing a fix to a link in the
	docs.

	FIXED: Issue #69 (bug in how find/findall handle tokenized sequences)

	MISC:
	Output encoder "subs" now omits items that have no subs
	CLI failed to print compile errors occasionally

	NEW: librosie client programs now in their own directories within src/librosie
	NEW: 'make test' now takes optional CLIENTS arg, e.g. CLIENTS="c python"
	NEW: Enhancements (incl 'loadfile') to rosie.py
	NEW: Two sample C clients written (work in progress), one for static
	linking with librosie.o, and one for dynamic linking with librosie.so


2017-10-26  Jamie Jennings  <jjennings@us.ibm.com>

	* 1.0.0-alpha-4

	FIXED: Prior change log entry (in this file) was labeled alpha-2 when it
	should have been alpha-3.

	FIXED: Issue #65 where RPL files containing carriage returns (DOS-style
	line endings) were rejected.

	ENHANCED: A maximum of 99 syntax errors are reported when loading RPL
	code.  Otherwise, it can take a long time for all the error reports to
	be generated when loading a random (non-RPL) file.

	FIXED: Added necessary reporting of an error when RPL code tries to bind
	an imported identifier (e.g. 'word.any' as opposed to 'any').

	NEW: "Dark launch" of enhanced character set expressions, in which
	identifiers and other RPL expressions can appear.  E.g.
	'[ "Hi" [:alpha:] num.int ]' will match the two-character string "Hi", a
	single alpha character, or an integer (from the num package).
	Restriction: there must be at least one bracket subexpression, which in
	the example is '[:alpha:]'.  This feature should be considered
	EXPERIMENTAL.

	NEW: Sample docker files.  (We use these for testing, and thought we
	would share them.)


2017-10-23  Jamie Jennings  <jjennings@us.ibm.com>

	* 1.0.0-alpha-3

	FIXED: Bug triggered by multiple import statements in a single rpl file,
	where the error message did not print and some imports did not load.

	ENHANCED: To accomodate patterns that contain many thousands of
	alternatives, the maximum number of captures handled by the lpeg vm has
	been increased to 1 million.  It can go higher, but should it?

	NEW: "Dark launch" of a new operator called 'and', bound to the
	ampersand, e.g.  A & B & C === >A >B C which means "the input matches A
	and B and C, and the capture will be done using pattern C".

2017-10-22  Jamie Jennings  <jjennings@us.ibm.com>

	* 1.0.0-alpha-2

	NEW: Python module (librosie.so, rosie.py)

	NEW: Tests of some basic macros (halt, message, find, findall, and a
	shallow version of the case-insensitive macro called ci

	Note: The halt pattern is implemented, but the abend status of an
	attempted match is not yet available to the user.  I.e. the halt pattern
	is not very useful yet.

	Note: Memory management in librosie has been carefully designed,
	e.g. buffers are reused whenever possible.  BUT testing with a tool like
	valgrind has not been done yet.

	Modified: Backtracking limit for a single pattern is now 1000 (was 400)

	CHANGED: the find macro now looks for a cooked exp and adds boundary
	patterns automatically

	FIXED: bug in REPL (when entering rpl language declaration, e.g. 'rpl 1.0')

	FIXED: issue #63 (typo in README)

2017-09-20  Jamie Jennings  <jjennings@us.ibm.com>

	* 1.0.0-alpha-1

	First release under semantic versioning.
